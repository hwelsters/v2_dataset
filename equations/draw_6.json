For example, we can solve the second equation for nickels:\n\nnickels = 28 - dimes\n\nThen substitute this expression for nickels into the first equation:\n\n0.05*(28-dimes) + 0.1*dimes = 2.6\n\nDistribute the 0.05:\n\n1.4 - 0.05*dimes + 0.1*dimes = 2.6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n0.05*dimes = 1.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.05:\n\ndimes = 24\n\nNow we can substitute this value for dimes into either of the original equations to find the corresponding value for nickels. Using the second equation:\n\nnickels + 24 = 28\n\nnickels = 4\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is nickels = 4 and dimes = 24. We can check that this solution satisfies both equations:\n\n0.05*4 + 0.1*24 = 2.6\n\n4 + 24 = 28\n\nSo the solution is (4,24).", "prompt_tokens": 39, "completion_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 306}
