Here is one possible method:\n\n1. Solve one equation for one variable, in terms of the other variable. For example, from the first equation, we can isolate x by subtracting 3y from both sides:\n2x + 3y = 9.75\n2x = 9.75 - 3y\nx = 4.875 - 1.5y\n\n2. Substitute the expression we found for x into the other equation, and simplify. This will give us an equation with only one variable. For example, using the second equation:\n4x + 2y = 12.50\n4(4.875 - 1.5y) + 2y = 12.50\n19.50 - 6y + 2y = 12.50\n-4y = -7\ny = 7/4 or 1.75\n\n3. Substitute the value we found for y into either equation, and solve for the other variable. For example, using the first equation:\n2x + 3y = 9.75\n2x + 3(1.75) = 9.75\n2x = 3\nx = 1.5\n\n4. Check the solution by plugging both values into both equations:\n2x + 3y = 9.75 becomes 2(1.5) + 3(1.75) = 9.75 which is true.\n4x + 2y = 12.50 becomes 4(1.5) + 2(1.75) = 12.50 which is also true.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 1.5 and y = 1.75.", "prompt_tokens": 39, "completion_tokens": 387, "total_tokens": 426}
