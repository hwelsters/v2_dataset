We can isolate one variable in one equation and substitute its expression in terms of the other variable into the other equation, which becomes an equation in one variable that can be solved. Then, we can substitute back to find the other variable.\n\nHere's how it works for this system:\n\nFrom the first equation, we can isolate football_price as:\n\nfootball_price = (155.0 - 1.0*soccer_ball_price)/3.0\n\nWe can substitute this expression into the second equation, which gives:\n\n2.0*(155.0 - 1.0*soccer_ball_price)/3.0 + 3.0*soccer_ball_price = 220.0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3.0 to get rid of the denominators:\n\n2.0*(155.0 - soccer_ball_price) + 9.0*soccer_ball_price = 660.0\n\nDistributing the 2.0, we get:\n\n310.0 - 2.0*soccer_ball_price + 9.0*soccer_ball_price = 660.0\n\nSimplifying and collecting like terms, we get:\n\n7.0*soccer_ball_price = 350.0\n\nDividing both sides by 7.0, we get:\n\nsoccer_ball_price = 50.0\n\nNow that we know the value of soccer_ball_price, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find football_price. Let's use the first equation:\n\n3.0*football_price + 1.0*50.0 = 155.0\n\nSimplifying and solving for football_price, we get:\n\n3.0*football_price = 105.0\n\nfootball_price = 35.0\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nfootball_price = 35.0 and soccer_ball_price = 50.0", "prompt_tokens": 55, "completion_tokens": 404, "total_tokens": 459}
