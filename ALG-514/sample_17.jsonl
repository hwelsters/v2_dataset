In this case, we can multiply the first equation by 20 to get:\n\n40.0*grain_a + 60.0*grain_b = 360.0\n\nNow we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate grain_a:\n\n(80.0*grain_a)+(60.0*grain_b) - (40.0*grain_a + 60.0*grain_b) = 480.0 - 360.0\n\nSimplifying:\n\n40.0*grain_a = 120.0\n\nDividing both sides by 40.0:\n\ngrain_a = 3.0\n\nNow we can substitute this value into either equation to solve for grain_b. Let's use the first equation:\n\n(2.0*grain_a)+(3.0*grain_b)=18.0\n\n(2.0*3.0)+(3.0*grain_b)=18.0\n\n6.0 + 3.0*grain_b = 18.0\n\nSubtracting 6.0 from both sides:\n\n3.0*grain_b = 12.0\n\nDividing both sides by 3.0:\n\ngrain_b = 4.0\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\ngrain_a = 3.0\ngrain_b = 4.0", "prompt_tokens": 57, "completion_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 387}
