For example, we can solve the first equation for whole_wheat:\n\n(13.6*whole_wheat)+(3.4*whole_milk)=75.0\n\n13.6*whole_wheat = 75.0 - 3.4*whole_milk\n\nwhole_wheat = (75.0 - 3.4*whole_milk)/13.6\n\n2. Substitute this expression for whole_wheat into the other equation, and simplify to get an equation in only one variable:\n\n(2.5*whole_wheat)+(3.7*whole_milk)=15.0\n\n2.5*((75.0 - 3.4*whole_milk)/13.6) + 3.7*whole_milk = 15.0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 13.6 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2.5*(75.0 - 3.4*whole_milk) + 50.32*whole_milk = 204.0\n\n3. Simplify this equation and solve for whole_milk:\n\n187.5 - 8.5*whole_milk + 50.32*whole_milk = 204.0\n\n41.82*whole_milk = 16.5\n\nwhole_milk = 16.5/41.82 \u2248 0.394\n\n4. Use this value of whole_milk to find whole_wheat:\n\nwhole_wheat = (75.0 - 3.4*whole_milk)/13.6\n\nwhole_wheat = (75.0 - 3.4*0.394)/13.6 \u2248 5.40\n\n5. Check that these values satisfy both equations:\n\n(13.6*5.40) + (3.4*0.394) \u2248 75.0\n\n(2.5*5.40) + (3.7*0.394) \u2248 15.0\n\nTherefore, the solution is whole_wheat \u2248 5.40 and whole_milk \u2248 0.394.", "prompt_tokens": 57, "completion_tokens": 477, "total_tokens": 534}
