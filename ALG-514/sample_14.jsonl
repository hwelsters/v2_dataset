For example, from the second equation we have adult = 130 - child.\n- Substitute that expression into the other equation, and simplify to get a single equation in one variable. For example, replacing adult by 130 - child in the first equation gives (12.0*(130 - child)) + (4.0*child) = 840.0, which simplifies to -8.0*child + 1560.0 = 840.0.\n- Solve the equation for the remaining variable. For example, adding 8.0*child to both sides and dividing by 8.0 gives child = 105.0.\n- Substitute that value into one of the equations to find the other variable. For example, using the second equation we have adult + 105.0 = 130.0, which gives adult = 25.0.\n\nTherefore, the solution is adult = 25.0 and child = 105.0.\n\nUsing elimination:\n\n- Multiply one or both equations by constants that result in opposite coefficients for one of the variables. For example, we can multiply the second equation by 4.0 to get 4.0*adult + 4.0*child = 520.0, which will allow us to eliminate the child variable by subtracting from the first equation.\n- Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate one variable. For example, subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives (12.0*adult) - (4.0*adult) = 840.0 - 520.0, which simplifies to 8.0*adult = 320.0.\n- Solve for one variable. For example, dividing by 8.0 gives adult = 40.0.\n- Substitute that value into one of the original equations to find the other variable.
