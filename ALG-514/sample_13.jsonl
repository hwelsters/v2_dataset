Here's one way to use substitution:\n\nFrom the first equation, isolate donuts:\n3.0*donuts + 4.0*coffees = 4.91\n3.0*donuts = 4.91 - 4.0*coffees\ndonuts = (4.91 - 4.0*coffees) / 3.0\n\nSubstitute this expression for donuts into the second equation:\n5.0*donuts + 6.0*coffees = 7.59\n5.0*((4.91 - 4.0*coffees) / 3.0) + 6.0*coffees = 7.59\n\nSimplify and solve for coffees:\n(5.0*4.91 - 20.0*coffees) / 3.0 + 6.0*coffees = 7.59\n16.2533 - 6.6667*coffees + 6.0*coffees = 7.59\n-0.6667*coffees = -8.6633\ncoffees = 12.9947\n\nNow substitute this value for coffees into either equation to get the corresponding value for donuts:\n3.0*donuts + 4.0*(12.9947) = 4.91\n3.0*donuts = 4.91 - 51.9788\ndonuts = -15.0226\n\nTherefore, the solution is (donuts, coffees) = (-15.0226, 12.9947). However, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, since it would mean a negative number of donuts. \n\nThis indicates that there is no feasible solution to the given system of equations, which can also be seen by graphing the equations and observing that the lines do not intersect.", "prompt_tokens": 55, "completion_tokens": 427, "total_tokens": 482}
