Here's how to use elimination:\n\n1. Multiply both sides of the first equation by 5:  \n   5(smaller + larger) = 5(73)  \n   5smaller + 5larger = 365  \n   \n2. Rewrite the second equation with a positive coefficient for larger:  \n   5smaller - larger = 149  \n   -1(larger - 5smaller) = -149  \n   \n3. Add the two equations together:  \n   5smaller + 5larger - larger + 5smaller = 365 - 149  \n   10smaller + 4larger = 216  \n   \n4. Divide both sides by 2 to simplify:  \n   5smaller + 2larger = 108  \n   \n5. Now we have two equations:  \n   smaller + larger = 73  \n   5smaller + 2larger = 108  \n   \n6. Multiply the first equation by 2:  \n   2smaller + 2larger = 146  \n   \n7. Subtract the second equation from the first:  \n   -3smaller = -38  \n   \n8. Solve for smaller:  \n   smaller = 12.67 (rounded to two decimal places)  \n   \n9. Plug this value into the first equation to solve for larger:  \n   12.67 + larger = 73  \n   larger = 60.33 (rounded to two decimal places)  \n   \n10. Check our solution by plugging in both values:  \n    5(12.67) - 60.33 = 63.35 - 60.33 = 3.02 (rounded to two decimal places)  \n   12.67 + 60.33 = 73, so both equations are satisfied.  \n   \nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is:\nsmaller = 12.67\nlarger = 60.33", "prompt_tokens": 32, "completion_tokens": 421, "total_tokens": 453}
