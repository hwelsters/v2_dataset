Here's an example using elimination:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 5 to get:\n\n10*speed_boat + 10*speed_current = 750\n\nNow subtract the second equation from this to eliminate the speed_current variable:\n\n10*speed_boat + 10*speed_current - (10*speed_boat - 10*speed_current) = 750 - 150\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n20*speed_current = 600\n\nDividing both sides by 20, we get:\n\nspeed_current = 30\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into either of the original equations to solve for the other variable. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2*speed_boat + 2*30 = 150\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n2*speed_boat + 60 = 150\n\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get:\n\n2*speed_boat = 90\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nspeed_boat = 45\n\nSo the solution to this system of equations is:\n\nspeed_boat = 45\nspeed_current = 30", "prompt_tokens": 41, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 288}
